    title: Committee on Data in Research
    content:
      content_html: >-
        <p>The purpose of this committee is to bring together experts,
        communities and organisations involved in the production, measurement,
        collection, storage, and use of data in research. The term
        &ldquo;research&rdquo; is interpreted broadly, and includes aspects of
        data use in business and industry.</p><p>Sharing best practice and
        building relationships, both nationally and internationally, will add
        value to the work that we do, and open up new opportunities for
        collaborative research with enhanced benefit to Aotearoa New
        Zealand.</p><p>The Committee will foster a sense of community among
        those interested in Data.</p><p>The Committee and its community should
        have a clarity of purpose and a shared vision that reflects the values
        and principles embodied in Te Tiriti o Waitangi, all the way from
        gathering, measuring, storing, to using and reusing data, and everything
        in between.</p>

  # An example of using the bookshop tag directly,

  # Components are referenced by component name,
