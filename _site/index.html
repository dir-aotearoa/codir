The term “research” is interpreted broadly, and includes aspects of data use in business and industry. Sharing best practice and building relationships, both nationally and internationally, will add value to the work that we do, and open up new opportunities for collaborative research with enhanced benefit to Aotearoa New Zealand. The Committee will foster a sense of community among those interested in Data. The Committee and its community should have a clarity of purpose and a shared vision that reflects the values and principles embodied in Te Tiriti o Waitangi, all the way from gathering, measuring, storing, to using and reusing data, and everything in between.</p><h2><strong class="bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500">International Communities</strong></h2><div class="w-full max-w-max grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4 my-8 px-4 lg:mx-0"><a href="https://www.codata.org/" target="_blank" class="p-5 border rounded border-gray-200 hover:border-purple-400 items-center"><img src="/static/img/codata_new_logo-1.png" class="p-10 w-max justify-center items-center"><h3>CODATA - Committee on Data →</h3><p>CODATA exists to promote global collaboration to improve the availability and usability of data for all areas of research. CODATA supports the principle that data produced by research and susceptible to be used for research should be as open as possible and as closed as necessary.</p></a><a href="https://www.worlddatasystem.org/" target="_blank" class="p-5 border rounded border-gray-200 hover:border-purple-400 items-center"><img src="/static/img/wds_logo.png" class="p-10 w-max justify-center items-center"><h3>World Data System →</h3><p>The World Data System promotes long-term stewardship of, and universal and equitable access to, quality-assured scientific data and data services, products, and information across all disciplines in the Natural and Social Sciences, and the Humanities. WDS aims to facilitate scientific research under the ISC umbrella by coordinating and supporting **trusted scientific data services** for the provision, use, and preservation of relevant datasets, while strengthening their links with the research community.</p></a><a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/" target="_blank" class="p-5 border rounded border-gray-200 hover:border-purple-400 items-center"><img src="/static/img/rda_logo.png" class="p-10 w-max justify-center items-center"><h3>RDA - Research Data Alliance →</h3><p>RDA has a grass-roots, inclusive approach covering all data lifecycle stages, engaging data producers, users and stewards, addressing data exchange, processing, and storage. It has succeeded in creating the neutral social platform where international research data experts meet to exchange views and to agree on topics including social hurdles on data sharing, education and training challenges, data management plans and certification of data repositories, disciplinary and interdisciplinary interoperability, as well as technological aspects.</p></a></div></div><footer class="fixed h-max bottom-0 text-center w-full py-4"><small class="text-gray-500">Copyright © Committee on Data in Research 2022.
