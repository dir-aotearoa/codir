about: The purpose of this committee is to bring together experts, communities
  and organisations involved in the production, measurement, collection,
  storage, and use of data in research. The term “research” is interpreted
  broadly, and includes aspects of data use in business and industry. Sharing
  best practice and building relationships, both nationally and internationally,
  will add value to the work that we do, and open up new opportunities for
  collaborative research with enhanced benefit to Aotearoa New Zealand. The
  Committee will foster a sense of community among those interested in Data. The
  Committee and its community should have a clarity of purpose and a shared
  vision that reflects the values and principles embodied in Te Tiriti o
  Waitangi, all the way from gathering, measuring, storing, to using and reusing
  data, and everything in between.
