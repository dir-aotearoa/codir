      **[CODATA](https://www.codata.org/)** is the Committee on Data of
      the **[International Science
      Council](https://council.science/) ([ISC](https://council.science/))**.
       CODATA exists to promote global collaboration to improve the availability
      and usability of data for all areas of research.  CODATA supports the
      principle that data produced by research and susceptible to be used for
      research should be as open as possible and as closed as necessary.  CODATA
      works also to advance the interoperability and the usability of such data:
      research data should be **[intelligently
      open](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/science-public-enterprise/report/)** or **[FAIR](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/pdf/fair_eg.pdf)**.
      By promoting the policy, technological and cultural changes that are
      essential to promote Open Science, CODATA helps advance ISC’s vision and
      mission of advancing science as a global public
      good.[](https://codata.org/home)


      The **CODATA Strategic Plan** identifies three priority areas:


      1. promoting principles, policies and practices for Open Data and Open Science;

      2. advancing the frontiers of data science;

      3. building capacity for Open Science by improving data skills and the functions of national science systems needed to support open data.


      CODATA achieves these objectives through a number of **[standing committees and strategic executive led initiatives](https://codata.org/initiatives/strategic-programme/)**, and through its **[Task Groups](https://codata.org/initiatives/task-groups/)** and **[Working Groups](https://codata.org/working-groups).**  CODATA supports the **[Data Science Journal](http://datascience.codata.org/)** and collaborates on major data conferences like **[SciDataCon](http://www.scidatacon.org/2016/)** and **[International Data Week](http://internationaldataweek.org/)**.

      The World Data System (WDS) is an Interdisciplinary Body of
      the [International Science Council](https://council.science/) (ISC;
      formerly ICSU) created by its 29th General Assembly in Maputo, Mozambique
      in 2008.


      ### Vision and Mission


      In its Strategic Plan 2012–2017, ICSU has articulated its long-term vision of '*a world where excellence in science is effectively translated into policy making and socio-economic development. In such a world, universal and equitable access to scientific data and information is a reality and all countries have the scientific capacity to use these and to contribute to generating the new knowledge that is necessary to establish their own development pathways in a sustainable manner'*


      As an ISC Interdisciplinary Body, the mission of the World Data System is to support the ISC’s vision by promoting long-term stewardship of, and universal and equitable access to, **quality-assured scientific data and data services, products, and information** across all disciplines in the Natural and Social Sciences, and the Humanities. WDS aims to facilitate scientific research under the ISC umbrella by coordinating and supporting **trusted scientific data services** for the provision, use, and preservation of relevant datasets, while strengthening their links with the research community.


      ### Trusted Scientific Data Services and Data Communities


      To fulfil its remit, WDS is building worldwide ‘**communities of excellence**’ for scientific data services by [certifying Member Organizations](https://www.worlddatasystem.org/services/certification)—holders and providers of data or data products—from wide-ranging fields by using internationally recognized standards. WDS Members are the building blocks of a searchable common infrastructure, from which a data system that is both interoperable and distributed can be formed.


      ### Communities of Excellence for Scientific Data Services


      WDS brings its [Member Organizations](https://www.worlddatasystem.org/community/membership) together to coordinate their activities and through that process, to achieve an overall capability that transcends individual ones. Membership in WDS provides the imprimatur of ISC—the leading international and multidisciplinary nongovernmental scientific organization—and increases local and international scientific recognition. Membership also increases exposure to potential users and collaborators internationally. It demonstrates that the Member Organizations have a strong and tangible commitment to [open data sharing](https://www.worlddatasystem.org/services/data-sharing-principles), data and service quality, and data preservation—all of which are increasingly considered prime requirements by science funders and are high on policymakers’ agendas since they benefit the scientific community, economy, and society in general.


      ### WDS Strategic Targets


      The overall objectives of WDS are defined in its Constitution as follows:


      * Enable universal and equitable access to quality-assured scientific data, data services, products and information

      * Ensure long term data stewardship

      * Foster compliance to agreed-upon data standards and conventions

      * Provide mechanisms to facilitate and improve access to data and data products


      The strategy for achieving these objectives is outlined in the current five-year [Strategic Plan 2019–2023](https://www.worlddatasystem.org/organization/strategic-plan/strategic-plan-2019-2023), structured around three major targets:


      1. Improve the sustainability, trust in, and quality of open scientific data services

      2. Nurture active disciplinary and multidisciplinary scientific data services communities

      3. Make trustworthy data services an integral part of international collaborative scientific research

      ## RDA builds the social and technical bridges to enable the open sharing
      and re-use of data.


      The Research Data Alliance (RDA) was launched as a community-driven initiative in 2013 by the European Commission, the United States Government's National Science Foundation and National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Australian Government’s Department of Innovation with the goal of building the social and technical infrastructure to enable open sharing and re-use of data.


      RDA has a grass-roots, inclusive approach covering all data lifecycle stages, engaging data producers, users and stewards, addressing data exchange, processing, and storage. It has succeeded in creating the neutral social platform where international research data experts meet to exchange views and to agree on topics including social hurdles on data sharing, education and training challenges, data management plans and certification of data repositories, disciplinary and interdisciplinary interoperability, as well as technological aspects.


      The RDA Foundation provides the core business operations of RDA and represents RDA globally. [Learn more.](https://www.rd-alliance.org/about-rda/rda-foundation)


      ### The RDA Vision and Mission


      * The RDA Vision: Researchers and innovators openly share and re-use data across technologies, disciplines, and countries to address the grand challenges of society.

      * The RDA Mission: RDA builds the social and technical bridges that enable open sharing and re-use of data.


      ### RDA Guiding Principles


      * **Openness** – Membership is open to all interested individuals who subscribe to the RDA’s Guiding Principles. RDA community meetings and processes are open, and the deliverables of RDA Working Groups will be publicly disseminated.

      * **Consensus** – The RDA moves forward by achieving consensus among its membership. RDA processes and procedures include appropriate mechanisms to resolve conflicts.

      * **Inclusivity**– The RDA seeks to promote broad, balanced and inclusive representation of its membership and stakeholder communities.

      * **Harmonization** – The RDA works to achieve harmonization across data standards, policies, technologies, infrastructure, and communities.

      * **Community-driven** – The RDA is a public, community-driven body constituted of volunteer members and organizations, supported by the RDA Secretariat.

      * **Non-profit and technology-neutral** - RDA does not promote, endorse, or sell commercial products, technologies, or services and the development of open and re-usable recommendations and outputs within the RDA is mandatory.


      ### RDA Working and Interest Groups


      RDA addresses the need for open and interoperable sharing of research data and builds the social, technical and cross-disciplinary links to enable such sharing on a global scale.\

      **RDA Members come together through focused [Working Groups and Interest Groups](https://rd-alliance.org/groups/), formed by experts from all around the world – from academia, private sector and government**. Participation in RDA is open to anyone who agrees to its [guiding principles](https://rd-alliance.org/get-involved.html) of openness, consensus, inclusivity and harmonisation, with a community-driven, non-profit and technology-neutral approach.


      ### RDA Communities of Practice


      In an effort to build discipline or domain specific communities, the RDA introduced [Communities of Practice (CoP)](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/creating-and-managing-rda-groups/creating-or-joining-rda-community-practice) to its membership in December 2020. CoPs investigate, discuss and provide knowledge and skills within a specific discipline and/or research domain. Composed of experts from that area, CoPs are committed to directly or indirectly enabling data sharing, exchange and/or interoperability by serving as THE coordination focal point for RDA in those specific disciplines/research domains.


      ### RDA Recommendations and Outputs


      [RDA Outputs](https://rd-alliance.org/recommendations-outputs) are the technical and social infrastructure solutions developed by RDA Working Groups or Interest Groups that enable data sharing, exchange, and interoperability. They have an important impact on:


      * Solving data sharing problems

      * Adoption in infrastructure environments by individuals, projects and organisations


      To improve global data sharing, exchange and interoperability, RDA works on raising awareness and expanding the adoption of these outputs across all regions of the world.
