The establishment group will be recommending to the new committee that an early career group be established within the forum, and this idea did have some influence on our recommendation.</p><p>We wish to emphasise that the terms of reference for the committee specify a regular turn-over of membership, and we anticipate that applicants who have been unsuccessful in this round or any other members of the wider forum will join the committee in future.</p><p>We have called the meeting of the wider forum, with a view to securing your approval of our recommendations, and we hope that you will be able to attend that meeting and participate in the work taken on by the forum.</p><p>Ngā mihi</p><p>Richard Hartshorn</p></article></div><footer class="h-max bottom-0 text-center w-full py-4"><small class="text-gray-500">Copyright © Committee on Data in Research 2022.
